## Problem Section

### Section Title
**"Forms suck. Everyone knows it."**

### Problem Points
1. **People quit after 2 minutes**
   - They see a long form and give up
   - You get 10% response rates if you're lucky
   - The rest of your audience is gone forever

2. **You're missing out on responses**
   - Static forms feel like work
   - People don't want to scroll through 20 questions
   - Your survey sits there, collecting dust

   - Send it however you want

3. **Get responses**

## Why this works better

### Simple comparison
**Traditional survey:** Person sees 20 questions, gets overwhelmed, quits

**Barmuda:** AI asks one question, person answers, repeat until done

### The difference
- People finish because it doesn't feel like work
- You get more responses
- Better data quality because people aren't rushing through

---

## Pricing 

### What it costs
- **Free:** Try it out, see if it works for you
- **Paid:** When you're ready to collect serious responses

### Why we charge
- OpenAI API costs money for every conversation
- We need to keep the lights on
- This isn't a hobby project

A: Just copy-paste your questions. Our AI will figure out the format.
