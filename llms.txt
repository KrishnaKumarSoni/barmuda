## Forms suck. Everyone knows it.

People see a long form and give up. You get 10% response rates if you're lucky.


### Traditional surveys

#### People quit after 2 minutes

They see 20 questions at once and immediately feel overwhelmed. Most people abandon before starting.

#### Low response rates

Static forms feel like homework. People rush through or skip questions entirely.

#### Poor data quality

Rushed responses and random clicking leads to unreliable data you can't trust.

### Conversational surveys

#### Feels like texting a friend

AI asks one question at a time in natural conversation. No overwhelming forms to look at.

#### 3x higher completion rates

People actually finish because the experience is engaging and personalized.

#### Richer, authentic responses

No bias from visible options. People give honest, detailed answers in their own words.

## Three steps. That's it.

## Frequently asked questions

Everything you need to know about conversational surveys


### How does the AI understand natural language responses?

Our AI uses GPT-4o-mini with specialized tools to understand context, handle multiple answers in one message, resolve conflicts, and extract structured data from conversational responses. It's trained to handle edge cases like vague answers, off-topic responses, and questions people skip.

### How do I embed surveys on my website?

Copy-paste one line of JavaScript code and get a floating chat widget on your site. No complex setup, no iframes, no CSP issues. The widget works on any website and matches your brand colors.

### What types of questions can I ask?

Any type! Text responses, multiple choice, ratings, yes/no questions, and numbers. The AI automatically infers question types from your description. We also provide 12+ templates for common use cases like customer feedback and employee surveys.

### How do I analyze the responses?

View responses in your dashboard with charts, word clouds, and insights. Export data as CSV or JSON for Excel, Google Sheets, or analytics tools. All conversational responses are automatically structured into clean, analyzable data.

### Is respondent data private?

Yes. Respondents stay anonymous - no accounts or personal info required. We only collect device fingerprints to prevent duplicates. Your survey data is encrypted, stored securely, and only accessible to you.

### How much does it cost?

Start free with 100 conversations per month and 3 forms. Paid plans start at $19/month for 1,000 conversations with unlimited forms, embedding, and custom colors. No per-response charges - simple monthly pricing.

## Surveys vs Conversations
User interviewer at scale


# Why surveys fail, and  conversations succeed

Traditional forms are dying. People hate filling them out. Here's the data on why
conversational interfaces get 3x better results.


[Try it yourself](https://www.barmuda.in/) [See the data](https://www.barmuda.in/why#data)

## Traditional surveys are broken

The numbers don't lie. People are abandoning traditional forms at record rates.


67%

Survey Abandonment

of people quit surveys due to fatigue and poor UX

45%

Response Rates

down from 60% pre-pandemic, and still falling

18%

Drop Per Question

completion rate falls 18% from question 3 to 4

### The vicious cycle

You send a survey link â†’ People see 15 questions â†’ They think "this will take forever" â†’
They close it immediately. Even if they start, adding just one more question drops
completion rates by 18%. The result? Biased data from only your most engaged (or most angry) customers.


## Conversations change everything

When you make surveys feel like texting, people actually want to participate.


3x

Higher Response Rates

Conversational interfaces get people talking. They feel natural, not like work.

40%

Better Completion

One question at a time. No overwhelming forms. People actually finish.

### How Barmuda works differently

#### Feels like texting

One question at a time in a familiar chat interface

#### AI-powered

Smart follow-ups based on previous answers

#### No friction

No forms, no progress bars, no overwhelming lists

## The business impact

Better data collection means better business decisions.


### Better data quality

Get responses from your whole audience, not just the extremes

### Faster insights

Higher response rates mean you get actionable data sooner

### ROI improvement

Stop guessing what customers want - know it
